Programme Guide 2025
"Educational Excellence: Nurturing minds, hearts, and souls"

üìö EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE
At Franciscan Catholic School, we offer comprehensive educational programmes designed to nurture young minds and develop well-rounded individuals ready for the future. Our curriculum integrates modern teaching methods with traditional Catholic values, ensuring your child receives the best possible education.

Our programmes are structured to provide a seamless educational journey from early childhood through primary education. Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a strong foundation for lifelong learning and character development.

Our dedicated teachers are committed to recognizing and developing each child's unique talents and abilities, fostering a love for learning that extends beyond the classroom.

üéì EARLY YEARS PROGRAMME (Ages 1 ‚Äì 4 years)
Our Early Years Programme is based on the UK's "Early Years Foundation Stage" curriculum, adapted to include Catholic values and teachings. It provides an integrated approach to care and education which is play-based, following the interests of the children.

The framework ensures a consistent approach to care, learning, and development, enabling our educators to plan learning that is appropriate for each child at every stage of their development through a range of engaging activities.

The aim of our Early Years Programme is to help children achieve the five outcomes of the "EVERY CHILD MATTERS" principle while nurturing their spiritual growth and character development in a Catholic environment.

‚Ä¢ Creative Expression
‚Ä¢ Physical Development
‚Ä¢ Early Literacy

Our Primary Programme delivers a curriculum in an integrated manner through cross-curricular themes. It aims to promote healthy spiritual, moral, cultural, cognitive, and physical development in every child.

We run an integrated and unique curriculum with a clear process of learning and specific learning goals for every subject, with national relevance, global mindedness, and personal learning objectives. Catholic teachings and values are woven throughout the curriculum.

We have developed learning-focused activities across different subjects that help children develop awareness of themselves, their community, and the world around them, as well as inspiring positive action and engagement with global issues from a Catholic perspective.

üåç OUR BLENDED CURRICULUM
At Franciscan Catholic School, we believe that no single curriculum is perfect; each has its strengths and areas for improvement. That's why we provide a unique, comprehensive, integrated, and balanced curriculum that caters to all our children's diverse needs and learning styles.

We run a blended curriculum that ensures the best of the British and Montessori curricula is integrated with the Nigerian curriculum, all within the framework of Catholic education. This approach provides children with a world-class education that is relevant and prepares them for life in a globalized world as Africans and Catholics.

To complement our academic curriculum, we offer a variety of extra-curricular activities such as swimming, ballet, taekwondo, chess, and music. These activities help develop well-rounded individuals with diverse talents and interests.

Curriculum Approaches:
‚Ä¢ British Curriculum: Structured approach with clear progression and assessment frameworks that develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
‚Ä¢ Montessori Method: Child-centered approach that fosters independence, self-directed learning, and respect for each child's natural development.
‚Ä¢ Catholic Education: Faith-based framework that integrates spiritual formation and moral values throughout all aspects of learning.
