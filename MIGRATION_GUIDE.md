# Migration from Mock Data to Real Backend

## What Changed

### 1. Authentication System
- **Before:** Mock user data stored in JavaScript
- **After:** Real JWT-based authentication with backend API
- **Impact:** Secure login with proper session management

### 2. Data Storage
- **Before:** Hardcoded mock data in HTML/JS
- **After:** JSON file storage (ready for database migration)
- **Impact:** Persistent data that survives page refreshes

### 3. Payment Management
- **Before:** Static payment records in HTML
- **After:** Dynamic payment creation and retrieval
- **Impact:** Real-time payment tracking and receipt generation

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Portal
- Visit: `http://localhost:3000`
- Login with: `bursar` / `bursar123`

## Key Features Now Working

### ✅ Real Authentication
- Secure login with JWT tokens
- Automatic session management
- Role-based access control

### ✅ Payment Recording
- Add new payments through the dashboard
- Automatic receipt ID generation
- Persistent storage

### ✅ Dashboard Statistics
- Real-time payment totals
- Dynamic receipt counts
- Live outstanding balances

### ✅ Receipt Generation
- PDF generation with real data
- Email sharing functionality
- Professional receipt formatting

## Next Steps for Production

### 1. Database Migration
Replace JSON files with a proper database:
```javascript
// Example: MongoDB integration
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const PaymentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  studentName: String,
  amount: Number,
  paymentDate: Date,
  // ... other fields
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Security
- Add rate limiting
- Implement password reset
- Add two-factor authentication
- Use environment variables for secrets

### 3. Student/Teacher Portals
- Extend the backend for student accounts
- Add grade management
- Implement assignment tracking

### 4. Production Deployment
- Set up SSL certificates
- Configure nginx reverse proxy
- Use PM2 for process management
- Set up automated backups

## Testing the System

### 1. Login Test
- Go to portal page
- Select "Bursar Login"
- Use credentials: `bursar` / `bursar123`

### 2. Payment Test
- Navigate to "e-Receipts" section
- Fill in student payment details
- Click "Generate e-Receipt"
- Verify payment appears in "Recent Payments"

### 3. Dashboard Test
- Check that statistics update after adding payments
- Verify receipt counts increment
- Test PDF download functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is available
netstat -an | findstr :3000

# Install dependencies again
cd backend
npm install
```

### Login Issues
- Verify backend server is running
- Check browser console for API errors
- Ensure correct credentials are used

### Data Not Persisting
- Check `backend/data/` directory exists
- Verify file permissions
- Look for server error logs

## Support

For technical support or questions about the migration:
