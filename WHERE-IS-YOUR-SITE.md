# 🎯 SIMPLEST SOLUTION: Where is Your Website Hosted?

Your website is already live. To make the password system work 24/7, we need to know:

## Question: Where is your website currently hosted?

Common options:
- [ ] **Hostinger** (hostinger.com)
- [ ] **Namecheap** (namecheap.com)
- [ ] **GoDaddy** (godaddy.com)
- [ ] **Bluehost** (bluehost.com)
- [ ] **GitHub Pages** (github.io)
- [ ] **Netlify** (netlify.com)
- [ ] **Vercel** (vercel.com)
- [ ] **Other**: _________________

## Next Steps Based on Your Answer:

### If you use Hostinger/Namecheap/GoDaddy/Bluehost:
Contact their support and ask: "Do you support Node.js applications?"
- If YES → I'll help you deploy there
- If NO → We'll use Render.com (free)

### If you use GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel:
These don't support backend servers. We'll use Render.com (free) for the backend.

### If you don't know:
1. Check your email for hosting invoices
2. Or tell me your website URL and I can check

## 💡 Recommended: Render.com (FREE)
While you figure out your hosting, I recommend Render.com because:
- ✅ FREE forever
- ✅ No credit card needed
- ✅ Works with any hosting
- ✅ Setup in 5 minutes

Your website stays where it is, only the password system moves to Render.
